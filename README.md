AE4350 Bio-inspired Intelligence

Due 31/8/2024.

## Rubric

Method Complexity: Should be state of the art, continuous, and high-dimensional

Environment/application Complexity: Should be continuous, high-dimensional real-world problem.

Sensitivity analysis: varying multiple parameters in a sensible way, chosen to give insight into the most vital parts of the learning method.

## Topics

1. Reinforcement learning (control of simulated mechanical/electrical systems in aerospace/robotics/automotive fields; agent interacting with environment in a game; or agent-based optimization of a process, i.e. scheduling/path planning)
3. Evolutionary robotics (control of simulated mechanical/electrical systems in aerospace/robotics/automotive fields; agent interacting with environment in a game; or agent-based optimization of a process, i.e. scheduling/path planning)
4. Swarm intelligence (swarming task with a (preferably) large number of agents, with local actions (i.e. navigation); combination learning method like ER; or tasks, e.g. formation flight, foraging, construction, exploration, coverage, etc.)
5. Spiking neural networks (exploration/investigation of SNN learning/encoding/decoding/adaptation algorithms; task classification, e.g. regression, ER, RL, navigation; or using event-based datasets or encoding traditional datasets in a spiking matter)
6. Physical interaction, i.e. control (learn/design control of a robot which acts with its environment; automatic design and control for a robot that interacts with its environment; or learning control in a robot that has compliance, compared to a rigid setup)
